<H2 ALIGN=center> Fast spin spherical harmonic transforms </H2>
<H3 ALIGN=center> By Jason McEwen & Yves Wiaux </H3>

<p>
The SSHT code provides functionality to perform fast and exact
spin spherical harmonic transforms based on the sampling theorem on the
sphere derived in our paper:
<i>A novel sampling theorem on the sphere</i> (<a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/XXX.XXX">ArXiv</a>|<a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/XXX">DOI</a>).

<p>
This documentation outlines the various harmonic transforms supported
in SSHT, before describing installation details and documenting the C,
Fortran and MATLAB source code.  Reference, version, and license 
information then follows.

For an overview see the <a href="../README.txt">README.txt</a>
file.

<HR>
<H2> Spin spherical harmonic transform routines </H2>

<p>
Routines are provided to compute forward and inverse transforms using
our optimal sampling (the MW routines).  A extension of our sampling
theorem to a sub-optimal but diametrically symmetric sampling, which
is important for certain applications, is also provided (the MWSS
routines).

<p>
We also provide optimal routines to perform spherical harmonic
transforms using Gauss-Legendre quadrature (the GL routines), although
these are slower than the MW routines.

<p>
Finally, we provide routines to perform transforms based on the
quadrature of Driscoll & Healy (the DH routines).  Note that we do NOT
implement the fast Driscoll & Healy algorithms (which may be found in
s2kit) but simply apply the quadrature rule to implement a simple
algorithm based on a separation of variables, hence these routines are
slower still.

<p>
All of these transforms correspond to sampling theorems on the sphere,
with exact forward and inverse transforms for band-limited signals.
In practice reconstruction accuracy is limited by machine precision.
For all of the algorithms we find maximum reconstruction errors are of
the order 10^(-12) or smaller.  Please set our paper for a discussion of
the various algorithms implemented in the SSHT package and for a
comparison of their performance.

<H2> Installation </H2>

<p>
The S2DW <i>library</i> requires only the <a
href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a> and <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">CFITSIO</a>
packages.  If one wishes to also use the utility programs then the <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> and <a
href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~jdm57/software.html">S2</a> packages
are also required.  Please note that all S2DW code is written in
Fortran 90 and a suitable Fortran compiler will be required.


<H3> Compiling library </H3>

Before compiling you may need to edit the <a href="../makefile">makefile</a> to specify your
compiler and to link with the appropriate libraries.  Once you have
set the makefile up for your system then the S2DW library may be
compilied by running:
<pre> >> make lib</pre>

For details on how to use the S2DW library code see the documentation
<a href="#library">below<a>.

<H3> Testing </H3>

A test program is provided to test the installation of the S2DW
library.  To make this program simply run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make test</code>
</blockquote>
The test may then be performed by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make runtest</code>
</blockquote>
If you see the message '<i>Tests passed!</i>' printed then the S2DW
library has been installed correctly and is reconstructing the
spherical harmonic coefficients of a random test signal exactly from its
wavelet and scaling coefficients.  By default the test is performed at
a band limit of B=64.  To run the test for other band limits run:
<blockquote> <code>>> ./bin/s2dw_test xx</code> </blockquote> 
where xx is the band limit of the test.

<H3> Compiling utility programs </H3>
<p>
The utility programs require the <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> and <a
href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~jdm57/software.html">S2</a> packages
to handle real space representations of data on the sphere (these are
not required for the S2DW library).  Before attempting to compile the
utility programs please ensure that these libraries are
linked correctly in the <a href="../makefile">makefile</a>.  Once these
libraries are linked you may compile the S2DW utility
programs by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make prog</code>
</blockquote>

For details on how to use the S2DW utility programs see the documentation
<a href="#utility">below<a>.

<H3> Documentation </H3>
<p>
By default, the S2DW code ships with only this single documentation
page.  The remainder of the documentation is automatically generated
from the source code using 
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/f90doc/">f90doc</a>.  
Please ensure that you have f90doc installed in order to generate this
documentation.  Once f90doc is installed the documentation may be 
generated by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make docs</code>
</blockquote>

<H3> Cleaning up </H3>

To clean up your version of the S2DW code and return all code to its
original state run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make clean</code>
</blockquote>

To remove all documentation, except the front page (i.e. this file),
run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make cleandocs</code>
</blockquote>

<a name="library"><H2> Library documentation </H2></a>

The S2DW library contains all functionality to compute the scale
discretised wavelet transform on the sphere from the spherical
harmonic coefficients of a signal.  Real space representations of
signals on the sphere are not considered.  An overview of the modules
that comprise the S2DW library is given here.  Please click on the link
for each module for detailed documentation.

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_core_mod.html>s2dw_core_mod</a></CODE>: 
Provides core functionality to perform a scale discretised wavelet
transform on the sphere.

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_dl_mod.html>s2dw_dl_mod</a></CODE>: 
Functionality to compute specified plane of the Wigner dl matrix.

<p>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_error_mod.html>s2dw_error_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Functionality to handle errors that may occur in the S2DW
 library. Public S2DW error codes are defined, with corresponding
 private error comments and default halt execution status. 

<p>

<HR>
<a name="utility"><H2> Utility program documentation </H2> </a>

The S2DW utility programs provide functionality for dealing with data
on the sphere in real space, where the <a
href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> pixelisation of the
sphere is adopted.  Once spherical harmonic coefficients are computed,
the utility programs make use to the S2DW library to perform the scale
discretised wavelet transform on the sphere.  Please click on the link
for each program for detailed documentation.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_analysis.html>s2dw_analysis</a></CODE>: 
Computes the S2DW wavelet and scaling coefficients of a Healpix sky map.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_synthesis.html>s2dw_synthesis</a></CODE>: 
Reconstructs a Healpix sky map from S2DW wavelet and scaling coefficients.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_test.html>s2dw_test</a></CODE>:
Performs S2DW transform analysis and synthesis and check that the
original signal is reconstructed exactly (to numerical precision).
Note that this utility program does not deal with real space
representations of data on the sphere and hence does not require the
<a href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a> or <a
href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~jdm57/software.html">S2</a> packages.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_wav2sky.html>s2dw_wav2sky</a></CODE>:

to a sky Healpix fits file. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_wavplot.html>s2dw_wavplot</a></CODE>: 
Computes a Healpix sky map of wavelet for a given j for subsequent plotting.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_fits2mat.html>s2dw_fits2mat</a></CODE>: 
Converts a fits S2DW file containing wavelet and scaling coefficients to
a matlab S2DW file.

<P>
<CODE><a href=s2dw_mat2fits.html>s2dw_mat2fits</a></CODE>: 
Converts a matlab S2DW file containing wavelet and scaling coefficients
to a fits S2DW file.

<HR>
<H2> MATLAB usage </H2>

The data associated with a scale discretised wavelet tranform of a
signal (including wavelet and scaling coefficients and other
parameters) may be written to either a FITS or Matlab m file.  The
binary FITS files are considerably smaller and faster to read/write.
However, for users who wish to analyse wavelet coefficients in
Matlab it is also possible to write matlab readable m files.  Utility
routines also exist to convert between these two file types.  A Matlab
routine to write the data back to an m file from within Matlab is
provided in the ./matlab subdirectory:

<P>
<CODE><a href=../matlab/s2dw_matlab_wav_write.m>s2dw_matlab_wav_write.m</a></CODE>: 
Write S2DW data manipulated in Matlab to a S2DW m file that can be read
by Matlab and the S2DW Fortran code.
